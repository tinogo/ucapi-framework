    Find orphaned entities in activities on the Remote.

    Scans all activities and identifies entities that are marked as unavailable
    (available=false). These are typically entities that were deleted or renamed
    but still referenced in activity configurations.

    Authentication can be done via PIN (Basic Auth) or API key (Bearer token).
    One of `pin` or `api_key` must be provided. API key is preferred over PIN.
