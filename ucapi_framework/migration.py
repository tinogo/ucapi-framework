    Perform entity migration on the Remote by updating activity configurations.

    This method performs a comprehensive migration by:
    1. Fetching all activities from the Remote
    2. Finding activities that use entities from the old integration
    3. Replacing old entity IDs with new ones in all locations:
       - included_entities
       - button_mapping (short_press, long_press, double_press)
       - user_interface pages (command, media_player_id)
       - sequences (on/off)
    4. Updating each activity via the Remote API

    **Important:** The Remote uses `integration_id.entity_id` format where
    `integration_id = driver_id + ".main"`. For example, if your driver_id is "mydriver",
    the full entity IDs will be "mydriver.main.media_player.tv". This function automatically
    appends ".main" to the driver_ids provided in migration_data.

    **Note:** If a driver_id already ends with ".main", the framework assumes you've passed
    the full integration_id and will NOT append ".main" again. A log message will indicate
    this behavior.

    Authentication can be done via PIN (Basic Auth) or API key (Bearer token).
    One of `pin` or `api_key` must be provided.

    :param remote_url: The Remote's base URL (e.g., "http://192.168.1.100")
    :param migration_data: Complete migration data with driver IDs (without .main suffix) and entity mappings
    :param pin: Remote's web-configurator PIN for Basic Auth (username: "web-configurator")
    :param api_key: Remote's API key for Bearer token authentication

    :raises ValueError: If neither pin nor api_key is provided

    Example - Using PIN:
